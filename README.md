# ng-express-gulp
Base structure for an angular, gulp, and express project with browser-sync and gulp-nodemon for live previews.

### Install

You **must** have node installed first. Download [Here](https://nodejs.org/) or use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)

Install bower with npm

```
npm install -g bower
```

Install gulp
```
npm install -g gulp
```

Clone this repository and navigate into it 
``` 
git clone https://github.com/vrodriguez363/ng-express-gulp.git && cd ng-express-gulp
```

Now install with ` npm install && bower install`

### Usage

Navigate to the base directory in your terminal ` cd path/to/folder `, then run ` gulp `. This should open a new browser tab. 

The structure is set and files are being watched. When you change a file and save, the browser should reload with the updated changes.
